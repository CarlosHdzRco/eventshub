# Events Hub
Welcome to Events Hub. This is the place to go to find local events, anything from meetups, parties, and contests to workshops, festivals, conferences, and more. See who else is going and join the fun! Want to plan and host your own event? You can do that too!

Currently available in Nashville, TN; Richmond, VA; and Atlanta, GA.

## Overview
### Accounts
At sign up, a user account is the default account type. With this account, you can search for events and view the events you've added to your My Events list.

If you want to be able to create events, you should specify at sign up that you want to be a host. With a host account, you can do everything a user account can do, plus create events and view all the events you've created.
### Search Events
Search for events in one of three cities: Nashville, TN; Richmond, VA; or Atlanta, GA. Simply select a date and see all the events happening either on the map or on the list of events for the day. If you see an event that catches your eye, add it to your list of events you're attending!
### My Events
See all the events you're attending in one place, and see who else is going to each of them. If you no longer want to or can't attend a certain event, you can easily delete it from your list.
### Create Events
**For host accounts only**. Want to host your own event? Choose the city, drop a pin at the location, name the event, choose the date and time, choose an event type, and type in a description. When you're all set, submit the event to make it available for others to join. Get the word out there and see who ends up signing up!
### Events I Created
**For host accounts only**. Much like My Events, see all the events you've created in one place, and see who else is going to each of them. And if you have to cancel an event for any reason, simply delete it from your list.
